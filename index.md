# 🎉 MoF - Simplifying AI for Everyone

## 📄 Overview
MoF introduces Flow Matching Mixture of Experts (FM-MoE). This powerful framework enhances conventional experts by using flow matching networks. Each expert learns a continuous transformation through an ordinary differential equation (ODE). With MoF, you can enjoy more expressive feature mappings while keeping the efficiency of sparse experts.
